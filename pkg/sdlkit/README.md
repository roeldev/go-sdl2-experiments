Package `sdlkit` contains basic building blocks when using `SDL2` with go. It
uses `github.com/veandco/go-sdl2` at its base and builds upon it. This package is not necessarily a
game or physics engine, but does provide enough common structs and functions to easily make your
ideas become a reality.

```sh
go get github.com/roeldev/go-sdl2-experiments/pkg/sdlkit
```

```go
import "github.com/roeldev/go-sdl2-experiments/pkg/sdlkit"
```

## SDL2 installation on Windows

- install a gcc compiler (for example `tdm-gcc`
  from [https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/))
- make sure all gcc related executables are available through your PATH environment variable, test
  this by running `gcc -v`
- run `go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl@master`
- run `go mod vendor` to create/sync vendor directory
- run `git submodule add https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2-libs.git .go-sdl2-libs`
- copy/symlink `.go-sdl2-libs`
  to `vendor/github.com/veandco/go-sdl12/.go-sdl2-libs`
- build/run your project with the `-tags static` build flag
- optionally add the `-v -x` build flags to output the files that are compiled
